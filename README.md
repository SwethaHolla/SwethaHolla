## 👋 Hello and welcome!

I'm Swetha Holla, I am a Data Science graduate from the University of Glasgow and a data science consultant. In my final year dissertation project, I combined data analysis and machine learning and developed a predictive model for horse racing outcomes using pre-race features and betting data to identify winning patterns.

Before this, I worked as a software engineer, and now I’m passionate about using data to understand real-world problems, from financial trends to community behavior online.
